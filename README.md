A repo for Miguel's ISYE 7406 Project for predicting 2022 Senate Midterm Election Winners.

This project was done for the Fall 2022 semester at Georgia Tech. We had the unique opportunity to create a predictive model for senate midterm election winners and validate it in real time after the elections occurred.
